Captures the visible area of the currently active tab in the specified window. In order to call this
method, the extension must have either the <all_urls> permission or the activeTab permission. In
addition to sites that extensions can normally access, this method allows extensions to capture

sensitive sites that are otherwise restricted, including chrome:-scheme pages, other extensions’
pages, and data: URLs. These sensitive sites can only be captured with the activeTab permission.
File URLs may be captured only if the extension has been granted file access.
